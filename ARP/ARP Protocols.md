### What is Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)?

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network protocol which works on the datalink layer and has an important role in the communication of devices. The main task of the ARP protocol is to ensure that Logical and Physical addresses are matching with each other and to identify the MAC address of a device with a known IP address.
### Working Structure of the ARP Protocol

When two devices in a network start to communicate with each other, the target device’s MAC address and IP address must be known. The ARP protocol helps determine the MAC address of a device with a known IP address. The following image shows how this process takes place:

![[image-23.png]]

The device A sends the “**ARP Request**” (Broadcast) packet to all devices in the network. None of the devices replies back to this request except for the device with the IP address in the ARP Request Packet as they all can see that the IP address in the ARP packet does not belong to any of them. Seeing its own IP address, device B sends its own MAC address through an "ARP Reply" packet to the device sending the ARP Request.

**Note** : IP addresses and MAC addresses on the visuals are written as representative ones.
### ARP Table

In the previous image, the device A acquired the MAC address of the device C using the ARP protocol. This acquired MAC address is kept in the ARP table on the device A for a certain period of time. Similarly, all devices in the network hold the IP address and MAC address information of other devices in the network in the ARP tables for a certain period of time. Thanks to the ARP tables, it is determined whether the MAC address information of the target device is on the device to send the network packet. As in the examples above, it is a “Dynamic” process to save the MAC address directly in the ARP table by asking the devices in the network directly. Another type of ARP table registration process is the “static” registration process. Necessary values ​​in the ARP table are entered manually via the command line to add a static type of record. You can see the type of records when you display the ARP table of the device.

## Displaying the ARP Table on Windows

The “arp -a” command is used to see the ARP table on Windows. For example, let's see by applying the command:

![[image-25.png]]

As shown in the image above, the command has been applied successfully and the records on the ARP table are displayed.

## Displaying the ARP Table on Linux

The “sudo arp” command is used to see the ARP table on Linux. For example, let's see by applying the command:

![[image-26.png]]

As shown in the image above, the command has been applied successfully and the records on the ARP table are displayed.

### ARP Protocol Header

The ARP protocol has its own header structure. As seen in the example below, there are many fields in the header of the protocol. The information of the protocol is included in these fields. The following image shows the header and fields of the ARP protocol:

![[image-27.png]]


Each Field is briefly explained in the following titles:

  

## Hardware Type

The value in Hardware Type field indicates the network type. In other words, it includes the value that shows the protocol in the datalink layer. It is “2 byte” long. For example, the value “0x0001” here in this field indicates that it has “ethernet”.

**Note:** The value starting with “0x” means “**Hexadecimal**”.

  

## Protocol Type

The value in the Protocol Type field indicates the value that shows the protocol in the network layer. It is “2 byte” long. For example, the value “0x0800”  here in this field indicates that it is “Internet Protocol” (IP).

  

## Hardware Length

Hardware Length field shows the length of hardware address. It is “1 Byte” long. For example, since the MAC address is used as hardware address for ethernet, the “6” value is included in this field because MAC addresses are 6 byte long.

  

## Protocol Length

Protocol Length field shows the length of the protocol address. It is “1 Byte” long. For example, since the IPv4 address is usually used for the IP protocol, the “4” value is included in this field because IPv4 addresses are “4 byte” long.

  

## Operation Code

Operation Code field is the area where the task of the frame of the ARP protocol. It is “2 byte” long. For example, if there is “1” value in this field, it is an “ARP Request” type and if there is “2” in this field, it is an “ARP Reply” type.

  

## Sender Hardware Address

Sender Hardware is the field with the hardware address of the device that sends the frame. For example, this is the field where the sender’s MAC address is for Ethernet. The length of this area varies according to the protocol. The length of the 'Sender Hardware Address' should be 6 bytes if the Ethernet protocol is used.

  

## Sender Protocol Address

Sender Protocol Address field is where the sender’s protocol address is. For example, it is the field where the sender’s IP address is written for the IP protocol. The length of this area varies according to the protocol. The length of the 'Sender Protocol Address' should be 4 bytes if the IP protocol is used.

  

## Target Hardware Address

Target Hardware is the field where the hardware address of the device that will receive the frame. For example, it is where the recipient's MAC address is written for Ethernet. The length of this area varies according to the protocol.

  

## Target Protocol Address

Target Protocol Address field is where the Protocol address of the device that will receive the frame. For example, it is the area where the IP address of the recipient for the IP protocol is written. The length of this area varies according to the protocol.

  

### Reviewing the ARP Protocol with Wireshark

There are some tools with a graphical user interface (GUI) that help reviewing network packets in detail. One of these is “**Wireshark**”. Let's see each field described above through Wireshark:

As seen in the image above, the fields of the ARP protocol have been displayed successfully through Wireshark.

**Note:** You can access the PCAP file in this example in the “Course Files” field at the end of the course.

We have covered the basics of the ARP Protocol in this part of our training. Topics we have covered are what the ARP protocol is, its working structure, table, and header fields of the ARP Protocol. We will cover “**Internet Protocol (IP)**” in the next part of the training.
