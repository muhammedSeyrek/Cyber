# Introduction to Network Log Analysis

The components that make up the concept of the Internet and its infrastructure are network devices. It would not be possible to talk about the internet without the network devices which we keep using with different roles and categories day by day. In the past, a network communication reached its destination by passing through devices such as hubs, switches, and routers, but today, many devices with different tasks (such as Firewall, IPS/IDS, Proxy, and WAF) come into play with different tasks and capabilities.

Within the scope of this training, we will cover the analysis of the logs of important network devices and services that carry the traces within the network communications.

At the end of the training, you will learn how to analyze logs of important network equipment that a SOC Analyst needs to know. The logs shared during the training are shared as an example. Each device, product, application logs are unique and may differ according to the examples within the scope of training. The important thing here is to understand the essence of the subject.

### Generic Log Analysis (Netflow)

Netflow is a network protocol that collects IP traffic information. Although it was developed by Cisco, it supports Netflow from different manufacturers. Some manufacturers support Sflow or different similar protocols. It is important for it to provide visibility on the network with this protocol regardless of its brand or the developer of the protocol.

  
  

Thanks to this visibility;

- ISPs can bill for services

- It is used in network design or analysis

- It is used for network monitoring. (The sources that generate the most traffic, the most used port information, etc.)

- Service quality can be measured

- It provides information for SOC analysts for the detection of anomalies.

  
  
  

Netflow works in a stateful structure and monitors and reports all IP traffic passing over the monitored interface. Every IP communication here is defined as a flow. Flow is the set of packets that make up the communication between the source and destination. The information collected for the formation of Flow are as follows;

  

- Source IP Address

- Destination IP Address

- Source Port (Only for UDP ve TCP protocols)

- Destination Port (Only for UDP ve TCP protocols)

- IP Protocol

- Interface Information

- IP Version Information

   

An example NetFlow output;

**NOTE:** Devices producing NetFlow data usually do not produce this data in legible format as text. The output below is taken from applications that convert this data into a format that we can read.

![[generic-1 1.png]]

In order to create NetFlow data, NetFlow settings are configured on the supported routers or switches on the network. These configurations can be made over the host’s command line or web interface. Hosts transmit this data to network devices such as “Netflow Collector” or “Netflow Analyzer”. These will process the incoming NetFlow data and generate them into a report by visualizing the data on their interfaces according to their capabilities.


Via the NetFlow outputs, we can detect:

- Abnormal traffic volume increases

- Data leaks

- Access to private systems

- New IPs in the network

- Systems accessed for the first time as well as analyze related issues


### Firewall Log Analysis

Firewalls are physical or virtual devices that control incoming and outgoing packets on the network according to rules created depending on the network’s cyber policies. Each system/server may have its own firewall application, or a public facing firewall device may be placed for central management of the network in large organizations. In this way, network communication primarily passes through the firewall and reaches its destination according to the rules determined on the firewall setup.

In this sense, firewalls are one of the most important security components as it controls network access in organizations. Therefore, it is extremely important for the SOC Analyst to be able to analyze the logs produced by the firewall devices.

  

Compared to the past, today's firewall devices not only decide where the packets will go (OSI Layer-3) according to the determined rules, but also undertake different tasks thanks to its additional modules. For example, it can recognize applications and their content (OSI Layer-7). In other words, firewalls that recognize which application (http, https, ssh, dns, etc.) make the communication in the application layer are defined as NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall). Application names that are mentioned in the firewall logs, app, and services etc. describe this firewall as NGFW. The fact that it recognizes an application allows to write application-based rules while writing rules on the firewall. That actually means that just blocking packets with destination port 22 to forbid outbound ssh access does not mean that ssh traffic is completely blocked. When the target application is defined as SSH instead of target port 22, the firewall will recognize it at the application layer, and block the ssh access regardless of the port that the ssh communication carried out.

  

The most essential firewall logs are the logs of the traffic passing over the device. Basically, this log provides us traffic time, source IP/Port information, destination IP/Port information, interface information, location information, etc.

  

### A sample firewall traffic log

date=2022-05-21 time=14:06:38 devname="FG500" devid="FG5HSTF109K" eventtime=1653131198230012501 tz="+0300" logid="0000000013" type="traffic" subtype="forward" level="notice" vd="root" srcip=172.14.14.26 srcname="CNL" srcport=50495 srcintf="ACC-LAN" srcintfrole="lan" dstip=142.250.186.142 dstport=443 dstintf="Wan" dstintfrole="wan" srccountry="Reserved" dstcountry="United States" sessionid=445180938 proto=6 action="accept" policyid=284 policytype="policy" poluuid="8ec32778-a70a-51ec-9265-8fdf896d07f1" service="HTTPS" trandisp="snat" transip=89.145.185.195 transport=50495 duration=72 sentbyte=2518 rcvdbyte=49503 sentpkt=13 rcvdpkt=42

  

#### Looking at the details of the above log

date= Date

time= Time

devname= Hostname

devid= Device ID

eventtime= 1653131198230012501

tz= time zone

logid= Log ID

type= Log Type (traffic, utm, event, etc.)

subtype=Sub Log Type (Forward, vpn, webfilter, virus, ips, system, etc.)

level= log level

srcip= Source IP Address

srcname= Source Hostname

srcport= Source Port

srcintf= Name of the Source Interface

srcintfrole= Role of the Source Interface

dstip= Destination IP Address

dstport= Destination Port

dstintf= Name of the Destination Interface

dstintfrole= Role of the Destination Interface

srccountry= Source IP information (Country)

dstcountry= Destination IP information (Country)

action= info on the action taken (drop, deny, accept, etc.)

service= service information

transip= NAT IP info (internal output of the private source address)

transport= NAT port info

duration= time elapsed

sentbyte= size of the packets sent (byte)

rcvdbyte= size of the packets received (byte)

sentpkt= number of the packets sent

rcvdpkt= number of the packets received

  

When performing log analysis, the very first thing we need to check is the IP and port information. After we have the IP and port information we should check whether this traffic reaches the target or not under the "action" section. In other words, the firewall log will provide us the information on source and destination of the traffic as well as on what port it is carried out.

  
  

As action;

  
  

- **accept:** indicates that the packet passed successfully.

- **deny:** packet transmission is blocked, information is returned back to the IP address that it is blocked.

- **drop:** packet transmission is blocked. No information is returned back to the IP address that it is blocked.

- **close:** indicates that the communication is mutually terminated.

- **client-rst:** indicates that the communication was terminated by the client.

- **server-rst:** indicates that the communication was terminated by the server.

  

For example, checking the firewall logs, you will be able to find information on whether the network communication has been established with an IP address that has been forwarded to you for your review. It will make you search easier if you filter down your findings by the source and destination IP addresses. Firewall logs are one of the most important resources for the SOC Analyst to refer to when investigating incidents, cases, suspicious activities. For example, it will be very important to find the details like below:

  
  

- Is there a accept request at different times from the IP address that was detected as attacking and denied by the IPS on firewall logs?

- Checking the firewall logs, you will be able to find whether there is access to/from the suspicious IPs/Domains obtained as a result of the analysis of the malicious content in the antivirus logs.

- Firewall traffic logs are also good resources to detect which different systems an infected system is communicating within the network.

  

#### Through the firewall logs, suspicious activities like:

- Port-Scan activities

- Communication detection with IoCs

- Lateral (lan-lan) or vertical (lan-wan, wan-lan) unauthorized access can be detected


### VPN Log Analysis

VPN is the technology that allows you to connect to a local network that you are not physically connected to. Generally, organizations prefer this technology to access their internal systems remotely. Today, it is known as a technology to access sites that are not accessible. The logic here works like this; you are able to access sites you normally cannot access from your current location by switching your location to a different location (connecting to the internet as if you were there).

  

VPN technology for enterprise networks is an indispensable type of access. Therefore, VPN logs are crucial for the daily routine of SOC Analysts. Since VPN is one of the services that are open public, it becomes as an entry point for attackers. Data such as time information, source IP information, user information in the VPN logs are among the most useful information for the analysts when investigating events/alarms.

  

VPNs are generally used over the organization's existing Firewall (firewall that supports VPN). In addition, it is possible to see products that provide dedicated services only for VPNs in some networks. In summary, VPN logs may be obtained from Firewall devices as well as other devices that only provide VPN service.

  

### An example VPN log

date=2022-05-21 time=14:06:38 devname="FG500" devid="FG5HSTF109K" eventtime=1653134913959078891 tz="+0300" logid="0101039424" type="event" subtype="vpn" level="information" vd="root" logdesc="SSL VPN tunnel up" action="tunnel-up" tunneltype="ssl-web" tunnelid=462105151 remip=13.29.5.4 user="letsdefend-user" reason="login successfully" msg="SSL tunnel established"
#### When we review the details of the above log

date= Date

time= Time

devname= Hostname

devid= Device ID

eventtime= 1653131198230012501

tz= time zone

logid= Log ID

type= Log Type (traffic, utm, event, etc.)

subtype=Sub Log Type (Forward, vpn, webfilter, virus, ips, system, etc.)

level= log level

logdesc= log description

action= action taken

tunneltype= VPN tunnel type

remip= IP address that established the VPN connection

user= User information

reason= VPN Connection Request Result

msg= Message (Detailed message after the access)

The most important information to review in the VPN log is the IP address that makes the connection, which user it connects to, and the result of this access request (successful-failure status). The given sample log is a log of the VPN service running as an additional module on a firewall. Therefore, the type is listed as “event” and the subtype is “vpn”. After a successful VPN connection, an IP is assigned to you for your access through the VPN system. The log of the assigned IP information may be sent either in the same log record or in a different log. In addition to the information in the sample log above, you can also see the IP information assigned to you with the “tunnelip” value in the other log after successful VPN connection.

When we review the sample vpn log above, we can detect that a successful VPN access has been established as the IP address that makes the VPN request is 13.29.5.4, the user name is "letsdefend-user" and the message produced by the device belonging to the VPN activity is "login successfully".

Your firewall traffic logs will be created with the IP address specified in the "tunnelip" assigned to you as the source IP address in the network activities carried out over the VPN going forward.

For example, SOC Analysts are expected to analyze VPN logs when faced with a scenario like the one below.


**Scenario:** After a phishing e-mail targeting the organization, it has been determined that some users in the organization opened this e-mail and entered their username and password information. For these users, it is necessary to check all the activities of these users in all services especially the ones publicly available accounts (i.e. VPN). The VPN logs of the relevant users should be analyzed. The successful access source IP and country information and whether these successful accesses are indeed made by the user should be further investigated.

  

Following suspicious activities can be detected through the VPN logs:

  
  

- Successful/Unsuccessful VPN accesses

- Detection of brute-force attacks against VPN accounts

- Detection of VPN accesses outside the specified countries

- Detection of VPN accesses outside the specified time periods
  

The traffic log on the same device for the successful VPN connection that we have reviewed its log above is as follows. (There is more than one record, only 1 has been added as an example.) As seen in the log, the firewall creates the log of this traffic first before the VPN access is made as the traffic/connection occurs on the firewall side. You can see that the **srcip** in this log and the **remip** values ​​in the VPN log are the same. The fact that the application (service) information in the traffic log is HTTPS is due to the fact that the VPN type used is SSL-VPN.


### Proxy Log Analysis

The Proxy basically acts as a bridge between the endpoint and the internet. Organizations generally use proxy technology for purposes such as internet speed, centralized control and increasing the level of security. A simple schematic drawing of the Proxy structure is shared below. Requests made by the client reach the Proxy Server first and then the Internet. Proxies can basically work in 2 different types:

  

**Transparent Proxy:** Target server that we access can see the real source IP address.

**Anonymous Proxy:** Target server that we access cannot see the real source IP address. It sees the IP address of the proxy as the source IP address. Thus, it cannot obtain any information about the system that actually made the request in the background.

  

Cisco Umbrella, Forcepoint Web Security Gateway, Check Point URL Filtering, and Fortinet Secure Web Gateway products are examples of well-known proxy solutions in the market.

![[proxy.png]]

  
The proxy working structure controls the access of systems (server, client, etc.) to services such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP according to the determined policies and operates the actions taken according to the policies as block or pass actions. Although these policies vary depending on the proxy capabilities, it basically queries the URL/domain to be accessed from the category database, and if the category is a risky category, a block action is applied, otherwise a pass action is applied. Since some systems do not need to reach any networks other than some certain ones, an implicit deny may be applied to all networks other than the ones that are needed to be accessed.

  

### A sample proxy log:

date=2022-05-21 time=16:15:44 type="utm" subtype="webfilter" eventtype="urlfilter" level="warning" srcip=192.168.209.142 srcport=34280 srcintfrole="lan" dstip=54.20.21.189 dstport=443 dstintfrole="wan" service="HTTPS" hostname="android.prod.cloud.netflix.com" profile="Wifi-Guest" action="blocked" url="https://android.prod.cloud.netflix.com/" sentbyte=517 rcvdbyte=0 direction="outgoing" urlsource="Local URLfilter Block" msg="URL was blocked because it is in the URL filter list"

  

#### When we review the above log;

date= date information

time= time information

type= log type

subtype= log sub type (values like forward, vpn, webfilter, virus, ips, system etc.)

eventtype= event type that belongs to the sub type

level= incident severity level

srcip= source IP address

srcport= source port information

srcinfrole= source interface information

dstip= destination IP address

dstport= destination port information

dstinfrole= destination interface information

service= service information

hostname= requested domain

profile= source profile

action= action information

url= URL address requested

sentbyte = size of data sent by bytes

rcvdbyte= size of data received by bytes

direction= direction of the traffic

urlsource= URL sources

msg= message information

  

When we review the log we see that the request has been blocked to access the “https[:]//android[.]prod[.]cloud[.]netflix.com/” address of the system with the IP address 192.168.209.142 in the “Wifi_Guest” group due to the policy applied to the relevant profile. The reason why this request was blocked is because the url to be accessed is in the "Local URLfilter Block" list and access to the URLs in this list is blocked.

  

Proxy logs are one of the most important log types when a SOC analyst needs to check which domain/URL a system (server, client, etc.) is making a request to our internal systems and whether it was able to establish a successful connection. It is also important to be able to determine if the domain/URL is a risky category and if there were able establish any successful connections before.

  

- We can detect following suspicious activities through reviewing the proxy logs:

- Connections to/from suspicious URLs

- Infected system detection

- Detection of tunneling activities

  

For example, when the Forcepoint Web Security Gateway log below is examined;

  

Jun 17 10:47:00 10.10.18.11 CEF:0|Forcepoint|Security|8.5.4|194|Transaction blocked|7| act=blocked app=https dvc=10.10.18.11 dst=104.26.11.18 dhost=sentry-proxy.cargox.cc dpt=443 src=10.80.18.50 spt=61603 suser=Test_User requestMethod=POST requestClientApplication=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) cs1Label=Policy cs1=Block_Risk_Category_Policy(Servers) request=https://sentry-proxy.cargox.cc/api/3/envelope/?sentry_key\=e2506000e29247eba06eee9df3f011e0&sentry_version\=7

  

The Test_User user sent a POST request to the address “https[:]//sentry-proxy[.]cargox[.]cc/” with the Mozilla browser over its server with an IP address of 10.80.18.50 (it was determined by the name of the policy), and the target address was determined as “Block_Risk_Category_Policy( Servers)” policy and blocked according to the “act=blocked” action.

  

The domain category to be accessed in this log is expressed by the category number. The category number is 194. The equivalent of these numbers can be obtained from the following document. (Pages 31-36)

https://www.websense.com/content/support/library/web/v84/siem/siem.pdf

  

When we review category 194, we find out that there is a category belonging to suspicious domains in the form of "194:Extended Protection Suspicious Content".

  

After we review the log analysis above, we found out that the action is blocked, but it is clear that this request was made by a server, and the server may be infected and that it may be trying to access a different Proxy address in order to hide which destination it is actually going to. In this case, the analysis should continue more in depth and the process that made this request should be determined and examined. EDR/XDR log sources should be investigated for the continuation of this review.



### IDS/IPS Log Analysis

The IDS/IPS concept and solutions are technologies developed at the point where only rule-based access controls of firewall devices are not sufficient in the security world. Roughly, while the firewall works on a rule basis so that red apples shall pass and yellows not, IDS/IPS solutions can check whether there are worms in the apple or not. In other words, it has a decision-making mechanism by inspecting the packet content. In this way, it can prevent suspicious/malicious packets/requests from reaching the target and prevents systems from being affected by this attack.

  

Today, although IDS/IPS technology is provided by many Firewall manufacturers as an additional module/license on firewall devices, it is only available in devices with IDS/IPS as core functions.

  

### IDS vs IPS

- IPS: Intrusion Prevention System - Detects and prevents the suspicious activities

- IDS: Intrusion Detection System - Only detects the suspicious activities

  

IDS and IPS have signature database. A signature is a set of rules designed to detect known attacks. The structure that presents this set of rules centrally is called the signature database. An open source signature database link is shared below. These databases are constantly updated against newly formed attack vectors. Network activities that trigger these signatures can be blocked or only detected according to the determined action of the signature. In other words, IDS and IPS are the same device/product, but 2 different concepts/terms emerge according to the action in the signatures. Many firewall manufacturers can provide the IDS / IPS module with an additional license in their products. Snort or Suricata are two well known open source IDS/IPS solutions in the market.

  

You can access the source of open source code signatures from the link below:

https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-5.0/rules/

  

IDS/IPS systems are one of the sources that will generate the most frequent alarms amongst all in place security tools for the detection of network-based or host-based attacks. Because many attacks are on the network or endpoint, IDS/IPS systems can detect and block many suspicious activities. Many different attack categories such as log4j attack, post-scan activities, vulnerability exploits, botnet activities can be detected and prevented with the help of IDS/IPS technologies that are vital security solutions for organizations.

  

SOC analysts can usually access these outputs produced by IDS/IPS via SIEM or SOAR. SIEM presents the collected IDS/IPS alarms to the SOC Analyst by turning them into alarms with various rules/correlations according to their level, category, and occurrence in a certain number of times. These alerts can be investigated as an independent case or as a group by associating them with different alerts (Some SIEMs can also establish this relationship). For example, after the port-scan activity, the generation of events/alarms in the exploit category towards the targets that port-scan from the same source IP address will be associated with each other and considered as a red flag from the security perspective.

  

### A sample IPS log

date=2022-05-21 time=14:06:38 devname="FG500" devid="FG5HSTF109K" eventtime=1650585615163261716 tz="+0300" logid="0419016384" type="utm" subtype="ips" eventtype="signature" level="alert" vd="root" severity="high" srcip=12.11.2.4 srccountry="Reserved" dstip=19.66.201.16 dstcountry="United States" srcintf="AOS_LAN" srcintfrole="lan" dstintf="Wan_RL" dstintfrole="lan" sessionid=254830141 action="detected" proto=17 service="DNS" policyid=2 poluuid="6b5c8674-a36a-51ec-bbfd-2250544a9125" policytype="policy" attack="DNS.Server.Label.Buffer.Overflow" srcport=57673 dstport=53 direction="incoming" attackid=37088 profile="default" ref="http://www.fortinet.com/ids/VID37088" incidentserialno=254762092 msg="misc: DNS.Server.Label.Buffer.Overflow" crscore=30 craction=8192 crlevel="high"

  

#### Looking at the details of the above log

date= date information

time= time information

devname= system name

devid= system ID information

tz= timezone

logid= log ID information

type= log type (values like traffic, utm, event, etc.)

subtype= log sub type (values like forward, vpn, webfilter, virus, ips, system etc.)

level= log level

severity= incident severity level

srcip= source IP address

dstip= destination IP address

srccountry= source country

dstcountry= destination country

action= action information

service= service information

attack= attack details

srcport= source port information

dstport= destination port information

direction= direction of packet

attackid= attack ID information

msg= additional message information

  

IDS/IPS logs usually contain information about source-target IP and port information, action information, information about attack type, attack category, and attack level.

  
  
  

Following information should be investigated in details when analyzing IDS/IPS logs;

- The direction of attack (inbound or outbound) should be checked.

- The event severity level should be checked. Levels are usually set as low, medium, high, critical. High and critical levels indicate that activity is more important, quick action is required, and a false positive is less likely.

- A different signature trigger state should be checked between the same source and target. Triggering different signatures means that the severity level of the event should be raised higher and a faster action should be taken. The event is resolved within the service level agreement (SLA) depending on its severity level in case of following situations like:

        - If a single signature is triggered,

        - there are no different requests from the relevant source,

        - there is no different accept in the firewall logs.

- Is the port/service specified in the attack detail running on the target port? If it is running, the event level should be raised to the critical level, and the target system should be checked for infection. It should also be checked whether a response has been returned to the relevant system from the source. If the answer is no, blocking the attacking IP address as a precaution would be an appropriate action.

- Is the action taken just detection or has it been blocked as well? If the attack is blocked and there are no other requests from the same IP address on the firewall, we can wait a little longer for taking the action. However, if the action taken for the attack is only a detection, then other similar requests should be reviewed and block action should be applied if the content of the requests coming from the IP address is not false positive.

  
  

For example, in the example log given above, “DNS.Server.Label.Buffer.Overflow” attack was detected in the request made from IP address 12.11.2.4 to port 53 of IP address 19.66.201.16. When we look at the details of this attack which can be accessed via the ref. url in the log, we see that Tftpd32 DNS Server was affected by this attack. If the service running on port 53 of 19.66.201.16 IP address is not Tftpd32 DNS Server, we can say that it has not been affected by this attack. However, the fact that it says "detected" in the action section means that this traffic occurs between the source and the destination and is not blocked. In other words, this request made by the source IP address reached the service running on port 53 of the destination IP address.

  

Following suspicious activities can be detected monitoring the IDS/IPS logs;

- Port scanning activities

- Vulnerability scans

- Code Injection attacks

- Brute-Force attacks

- Dos/Ddos attacks

- Trojan activities

- Botnet activities


### WAF Log Analysis

WAF (Web Application Firewall) is the technology used to secure web-based applications. The analysis of firewall or IDS/IPS logs alone are often not sufficient for the detection of web-based attacks. The main reasons for this are the SSL offload issue and the control of the data in the payload (data) part of the web request.

  

SSL Offload is the decryption of SSL-encrypted traffic. The main purpose of the system is to reduce the load and increase performance, as well as to decrypt the encrypted traffic/request to make the content visible and controllable from a security point of view. In this way, invisible attack vectors in encrypted traffic become detectable or preventable.

  

In networks equipped with WAF, requests from end users reach WAF first over the internet. Then the WAF inspects the request, and makes the decision whether it will be transferred to the Web Server or not. One of the biggest advantages of WAFs here is that it can perform SSL Off-load, which helps examine the content of HTTPS traffic. WAF without SSL Offloading capability cannot provide a full effective protection as it won’t be able to inspect the payload (data) part of the HTTPS communication.


![[WAF.png]]


F5 Big-IP, Citrix, Imperva, Forti WAF products are examples of WAF solutions that are well-known in the market. In addition, Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS WAF solutions are also used as cloud WAF solutions.

WAF systems are generally the systems that handle the web access requests on the public faced systems. Therefore, we can say that WAFs are the first systems to detect web attacks and WAF logs are the ones that help SOC Analysts to detect suspicious activities. The analysts need to know their location on the network clearly when analyzing WAF logs. WAF logs are the source of the logs to view all web requests made, and to analyze detected web attacks or blocked web attacks. While examining the alerts generated for detected or blocked attacks, the reputation of the source IP address that created the log/alert should be analyzed also other similar activities that the source IP created in other log sources (such as IDS/IPS, Firewall) should be investigated.

### A sample WAF log:

date=2022-01-26 time=19:47:26 log_id=20000008 msg_id=000018341360 device_id=FVVM08 vd="root" timezone="(GMT+3:00)Istanbul" timezone_dayst="GMTg-3" type=attack main_type="Signature Detection" sub_type="SQL Injection" severity_level=High proto=tcp service=https/tls1.2 action=Alert policy="Alert_Policy" src=19.6.150.138 src_port=56334 dst=172.16.10.10 dst_port=443 http_method=get http_url="?v=(SELECT (CHR(113)||CHR(120)||CHR(120)||CHR(118)||CHR(113))||(SELECT (CASE WHEN (1876=1876) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END))::text" http_host="app.letsdefend.io" http_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b1) Gecko/2007110703 Firefox/3.0b1" msg="Parameter(Password) triggered signature ID 030000136" signature_subclass="SQL Injection" signature_id="030000136" srccountry="Germany" attack_type="SQL Injection"


All determined web traffic passes through WAF. In other words, you can find all web request records on the WAF logs.

#### Following is the information you can find looking at the details of the above log

date= date information

When the sample WAF log is analyzed, the source and target IP information should be checked since it references a high severity level SQL Injection attack type through signature detection. WAF’s response to this request should be checked if the reported attack is a generic (SQL intection, XSS, etc.) web attack as above. If the WAF did not block this request the response returned by the application should be checked. The response code of the response of the application (IIS, Apache, Nginx, etc.) is also important and should be investigated. If the application responded 200 for an attack that WAF could not prevent, it means that the attack reached the web server and returned a successful response. In some cases, the application returns code 200 while it should actually return code 404 due to some technical deficiencies in the application. These can be considered as false-positives for the relevant requests.

Examples of some of the application responses;

- 200 (OK): The request was received successfully and the response was returned.

- 301 (Permanent Redirect): The request was redirected to a different location.

- 403 (Forbidden): Data requested to be accessed is not allowed.

- 404 (Not Found): The requested content could not be found.

- 503 (Service Unavailable): The server cannot respond.

  

Response code categories:

- Informational responses (100–199)

- Successful responses (200–299)

- Redirection messages (300–399)

- Client error responses (400–499)

- Server error responses (500–599)


The connection request in the sample WAF log shared above was blocked due to the signatures that WAF recognize as malicious and generated an alert about it because of the expressions in the URL within the request coming from the IP address 19.6.150.138 to the port 443 of the 172.16.10.10 host behind the WAF. The policy name applied for requests matching this signature on the WAF is "Alert_Policy" and the action is set to "alert" which is monitoring mode. Therefore, we can say that the request reached the destination host.

If the attack reported by WAF for the requests is for the purpose of detecting vulnerabilities, it is necessary to look at the details of the vulnerability to be detected here. For example, if your web application is running on ASP and the vulnerability detection is a PHP application specific scan, then such a vulnerability cannot be expected to be reported. However, it would still be a good practice to take any actions for the IP address that performs scanning activity. The best action to take here is to block the inbound requests at the very first security device at the gateway where the inbound requests first interacts with our network.

We can help use WAF logs when analyzing the following detections:

- Detection of known web vulnerabilities

- Detection of variety of web attacks like SQL Injection, XSS Attack, Code Injection, Directory Traversal

- Detection of suspicious method usage such as PUT, DELETE

- Top requesting IP address information

- Most requested URL information

**Request Method:** Indicates which method the request is made within the web language. The main request methods are as follows.

- GET: It is used to retrieve data from the server

- POST: It is used to send data to the server (such as picture, video)

- DELETE: It is used to delete the data on the server

- PUT: It is used to send data to the server (sent data creates or updates files)

- OPTIONS: Tells which methods the server accepts



### Web Log Analysis

Today, most services are web-based and the web services of organizations are the most common services that are open to the outside world. This comes with a lot interest to the web attacks from the attackers point of view. Therefore, it is very important for SOC Analysts to be able to analyze web logs correctly. The most commonly used web servers are Microsoft IIS, Apache, Nginx. Although the applications are different, the web server logs have similar contents.

  

### A sample web server log

71.16.45.142 - - [12/Dec/2021:09:24:42 +0200] "GET /?id=SELECT+*+FROM+users HTTP/1.1" 200 486 "-" "curl/7.72.0"

  

#### When we analyze the above log

Source IP: 71.16.45.142

Date: 12/Dec/2021:09:24:42 +0200

Request Method: GET

Requested URL: /?id=SELECT+*+FROM+users

Version Info: HTTP/1.1

Server Response: 200

Data Size: 486

User-Agent Info: curl/7.72.0

  
  

### Request Method:

Indicates the method of the request within the web language. The main request methods are:

- GET: It is used to retrieve data from the server.

- POST: It is used to send data to the server. (such as picture, video)

- DELETE: It is used to delete the data on the server.

- PUT: It is used to send data to the server (sent data creates or updates files)

- OPTIONS: Tells which methods the server accepts.

  

Note: Usually (by default) web servers do not write the content of the data sent to the server by POST or PUT to the web log. Therefore, it is important to know this when analyzing web logs.

  

**Requested URL:** Indicates the directory/file on the server the request was made. At the same time, if there is an attack, it can be detected. As in the example above, “SELECT+*+FROM+users” statements represent us a “SQL Injection” attack pattern. Examining URLs is very important in web log analysis.

  

### Web attack types and sample request URLs
![[WEB.png]]

**  
Server Response:** Server responds back to the requests with some number expressions. These response codes indicates whether the request is successful or unsuccessful.

  

Let’s say you find the URL contains information about the sql injection attack vector while analyzing the web logs, then you should pay attention to the response of the web server;

- If 200 is returned: The request has successfully reached the server and the server has responded successfully, and the attack has been successful. Sometimes, application glitches cause servers to respond back with 200 while they actually should return 404. In such cases, to clarify this it is necessary to query the URL and analyze the response given to the request.

- If 404 is returned: The server returned "Not Found" because the requested url was not found on the server. In other words, we consider it as the attack failed.

- If 500 is returned: The server could not interpret this request and a "Server Error" response was returned. In other words, we can interpret it as the attack failed. However, since these requests on the server side prevent the web service from working properly, it is considered as a DOS attack by causing a service interruption while the attacker wanted to make a web attack.

  
  
  

The meanings of these status codes are as follows.

- 200 (OK): The request was received successfully and the response was returned.

- 301 (Permanent Redirect): The request was redirected to a different location.

- 403 (Forbidden): Access to the data requested was not allowed.

- 404 (Not Found): The requested content could not be found.

- 503 (Service Unavailable): Occurs when the server service cannot respond.

  
  
  

Categorical response codes

- Informational responses (100–199)

- Successful responses (200–299)

- Redirection messages (300–399)

- Client error responses (400–499)

- Server error responses (500–599)

  
  
  

**User-Agent Information:** Indicates the application that was used for the request. User-Agent information will help understand whether the requests made are by a real user or an automated scanning tool during the web log analysis. Some of the automated web scanning tools are “nikto”, “nessus”, “nmap”. If we see "Mozilla, Chrome", or a similar web browser information on the User-Agent information section that means the request was made by a real user. However, the User-Agent information may be changed and so we should be aware of that and make sure to verify the information we see within the logs.

  

If the web server you detect that it was attacked (through SQL injection, XSS attack, code injection, etc. methods) is behind the security devices (firewall, IPS/IDS, WAF, etc.) it means that this request (actually the attack) passes through these security devices. In summary, almost every detail is important to the analysts in the web log analysis.

  

Through the web logs, we can generate findings like below and use them in our analyses:

- Web requests with attack vector (SQL Injection, XSS Attack, Code Injection, Directory Traversal)

- Top requesting IP information

- Most requested URL information

- Most received HTTP response code

- Detection of suspicious method usage (such as PUT, DELETE)

  
  

### Analysis of sample web request, web log and output

#### Web Request

192.168.8.11/bwapp/sqli_1.php?title=%25iron%27+union+select+1%2Cuser%28%29%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7--+-+%25%27&action=search

  
  

#### Decoded Web Request:

You may decode them at (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder)

192.168.8.11/bwapp/sqli_1.php?title=%iron' union select 1,user(),3,4,5,6,7-- - %'&action=search

  
  

#### Browser output of the Web request
![[bwapp.png]]

### Web Log

192.168.8.54 - - [29/Jun/2022:07:42:48 +0300] "GET /bwapp/sqli_1.php?title=%25iron%27+union+select+1%2Cuser%28%29%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7--+-+%25%27&action=search HTTP/1.1" 200 13539 "http://192.168.8.11/bwapp/sqli_1.php?title=&action=search" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/102.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"

  

The log analysis of the above web attack shows that the attack was a SQL injection, made from 192.168.8.54, and was successful. We can see it was a SQL injection as the URL of the request contains expressions like "union”, and “select”, the response of the web server was 200, and the analyst was able to confirm that he was able to access the information from the database about the user “root@localhost”.

  

If you are interested in this subject, you can take a look at the "Detecting Web Attacks" training at the link below, which we have prepared specifically on how to detect Web attacks as a SOC analyst.


### DNS Log Analysis

DNS is one of the most basic building blocks of the internet. DNS is basically a technology that is used for domain - IP resolution. Network traffic is basically conducted over IPs and DNS is the system that tells us what the IP address for the server of google.com when we need to access "google.com" .

  

SOC analysts generally use DNS logs to check which domains and when they were requested during an incident investigation of a system. We should keep the followings when checking these logs:

  
  

- Has the system made domain requests in categories that actually should not access?

- Has the system made domain requests that are actually risky categories?

- Were any known services (google drive, one drive, etc.) attempted to access during situations like data leak, and etc.?

- Is there any systems that make requests to domains obtained from Threat Intelligence resources?

- Investigations on DNS logs should be conducted to detect if there is access to DNS Over TLS (DOT) or DNS over HTTPS (DOH) services.

  
  
  

DNS logs can be divided into 2 different categories from the SOC Analyst's point of view as the DNS server events, and the DNS queries.

  

DNS Server Records are simply the DNS audit events on the server that hosts the DNS records. These events are kept on "Application and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> DNS-Server\Audit" section on the Eventlog on Windows servers. Operations like adding, deleting, editing, records, etc. on the DNS server could be monitored on these logs.

  

For example, the screenshot below shows you the event about the deletion of the Event_ID: 516 deneme.dc.local with the details of who deleted it and on what server it was deleted inside the Default zone.

![[dns1.png]]


DNS queries are a difficult source of logs to collect and analyze. DNS servers do not keep these logs by default and they must be enabed in order for them to keep these logs. The DNS queries generated directly by the DNS service are also difficult to analyze. However, these are records where you can find which systems query the domains in the obtained IoCs. In summary, applications that provide DNS server services such as Microsoft DNS, Bind DNS, Dnsmasq record the DNS queries they receive upon request.

  

IOCs (Indicator of compromise) are the evidences that take part before, during and after a cybersecurity incident and are revealed during the analysis and investigation of that cyber security incident. The IOCs are crucial in determining the details like the type of the attack, tools leveraged during the attack, and who the possible attacker is.

  

Bind logs, that are DNS server services generally used in Linux systems, can be accessed via the "/var/log/querylog" log file in the default configuration.

  

### A sample DNS log

{ "timestampt": 1591367999.306059, "source_ip": "192.168.4.76", "source_port": 36844, "destination_ip": "192.168.4.1", "destination_port": 53, "protocol": "udp", "query": "testmyids.com", "qtype_name": "A", }

  

#### DNS query logs generally contain the following data

- Date-Time

- Querying IP, Port

- Query type

- The requested domain

  
  

Since the above example log is taken from a product (Bro/Zeek) that captures DNS records on the external network outside of DNS server, there is also the server information where the query was made along with the IP that made the query. For this reason, DNS logs can be obtained directly from the server, as well as in the systems that collect these queries over the network.

  

In DNS log analysis, the requested domain and its reputation/category are important. The domains utilized in the 2020 "SolarWinds SUNBURST" attack could have been detected by analyzing the DNS logs. The domains that a network device, a database or 3rd party application servers will communicate are clear. Domains that the manufacturer shared with you and are supposed to make communications should be investigated through the DNS logs for:

  
  

- First time visited domains

- Domains or subdomains over a certain character size

- Detection of NX returning domains

- Domain IOC controls

- Detection of DNS over TLS, DNS over HTTPS accesses

  
  

When the DNS logs below are analyzed, we see that there are DNS requests made towards subdomains that were randomly created from the IP address 192.168.10.12 in 1 minute time period. This activity of DNS requests may be a sign for a potential DNS tunneling activity. The investigation should be conducted at the endpoint by determining the source process that creates this activity.

![[dns.png]]

Our investigations on the DNS log below show that the requested domains appear to be legitimate. Considering that the Oracle Database server with an IP address of 192.168.10.3 is querying these domains, the Oracle server asking the domains of Microsoft services used for data transfer makes this activity suspicious.
